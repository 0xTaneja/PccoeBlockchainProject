\begin{abstract}
Event attendance verification and leave management systems in educational institutions often suffer from inefficiencies due to manual verification processes, the risk of fraudulent documentation, and delayed approvals. This research proposes ElizaEdu, a novel decentralized AI agent system leveraging ElizaOS and Ethereum blockchain to automate and secure the event attendance verification workflow. The system employs autonomous AI agents to handle document verification, approval workflows, and ERP integration, while utilizing blockchain technology to ensure tamper-proof records. Our implementation demonstrates a significant reduction in verification time (85\% faster than traditional methods), elimination of fraudulent documents, and increased transparency in the approval process. The integration with existing ERP systems provides seamless attendance updates without manual intervention. This paper presents the architecture, implementation details, and evaluation results of ElizaEdu, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing current challenges in educational attendance tracking systems.

\section{Introduction}
Educational institutions regularly face challenges with student leave requests for participation in events outside the institution. Traditional event verification processes involve manual document validation, multiple levels of approvals, and manual ERP updates, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and potential fraud \cite{kumar2019educational}. The current systems lack transparency, are time-consuming, and are susceptible to document forgery.

Current issues with event attendance tracking in educational institutions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual verification processes that require significant administrative time
    \item Risk of fraudulent or fake event participation proofs
    \item Delayed approvals and updates in ERP systems
    \item Lack of transparency in the leave approval process
    \item Inconsistency in record-keeping and attendance marking
\end{itemize}

In response to these challenges, we propose ElizaEdu, a decentralized AI-powered Web3 system that leverages ElizaOS autonomous agents and Ethereum blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and efficient event verification system. By combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, ElizaEdu automates document verification, ensures tamper-proof records, and provides transparent approval workflows.

The purpose of this research is to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design and implement a decentralized architecture for automated event verification
    \item Leverage ElizaOS AI agents to streamline approval workflows
    \item Utilize Ethereum blockchain to ensure data integrity and prevent fraud
    \item Integrate with existing ERP systems for seamless attendance updates
    \item Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system in real-world educational settings
\end{itemize}

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of related work in blockchain applications for education, AI-based verification systems, and decentralized storage solutions. Section 3 presents the methodology and system architecture of ElizaEdu. Section 4 details the implementation and integration aspects. Section 5 presents the results and evaluation of our system. Finally, Section 6 concludes with a summary of contributions and future work directions.

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Blockchain in Education}
Blockchain technology has gained significant attention in educational contexts for its potential to provide secure, transparent, and immutable record-keeping. Grech and Camilleri \cite{grech2017blockchain} explored the application of blockchain for educational records and credential verification. Their research highlighted the benefits of decentralized verification systems but did not address the integration with AI for document analysis.

Turkanović et al. \cite{turkanovc2018educhain} proposed EduChain, a blockchain platform for managing academic credentials. While EduChain addressed some issues related to certificate validation, it did not tackle the specific challenges of event attendance verification and leave management.

\subsection{AI-based Document Verification}
Automated document verification using AI has been explored in various domains. Hao et al. \cite{hao2020document} developed a deep learning approach for document verification that achieved high accuracy in detecting fraudulent documents. However, their work did not incorporate blockchain for ensuring the immutability of verification results.

ElizaOS, a framework for autonomous AI agents, has shown promise in automating complex workflows \cite{elizaos2023}. Its ability to coordinate multiple specialized agents makes it suitable for educational administrative processes, though applications in educational contexts remain limited.

\subsection{Decentralized Storage for Educational Data}
Decentralized storage systems like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) have been proposed for educational data management. Zhong et al. \cite{zhong2018data} explored the use of IPFS for storing educational resources securely. Their approach demonstrated benefits in terms of data availability and integrity but did not address the verification workflow aspects.

\subsection{Research Gap}
While previous research has addressed individual aspects of blockchain for education, AI-based verification, and decentralized storage, there is a notable gap in integrating these technologies to create a comprehensive solution for event attendance verification. Existing solutions either focus solely on credential verification or do not address the specific workflow requirements of leave approval and attendance management.

ElizaEdu aims to fill this gap by combining ElizaOS AI agents with Ethereum blockchain and decentralized storage to create an end-to-end solution that addresses all aspects of event verification, approval workflow, and ERP integration.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{System Architecture}
ElizaEdu employs a multi-layered architecture that combines AI agents, blockchain, and decentralized storage to create a comprehensive event verification system. Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the system architecture.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{system_architecture}
\caption{ElizaEdu System Architecture}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The architecture consists of the following key components:

\subsubsection{AI Agent Layer (ElizaOS)}
The AI agent layer comprises four specialized autonomous agents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RequestBot}: Handles initial document submission, performs preliminary validation, and generates cryptographic proofs.
    \item \textbf{VerifyBot}: Pre-screens documents for class teacher verification, provides validation metrics, and forwards approved requests.
    \item \textbf{ApproveBot}: Manages HoD approval workflow, ensures compliance with institutional policies, and records approvals on the blockchain.
    \item \textbf{ERPBot}: Automates attendance updates in the ERP system based on approved leave requests.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Blockchain Layer (Ethereum)}
The blockchain layer utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Store cryptographic hashes of submitted documents
    \item Record approval signatures from teachers and HoDs
    \item Maintain an immutable audit trail of the verification process
    \item Implement access control for different user roles
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Decentralized Storage Layer (IPFS)}
The decentralized storage layer uses IPFS to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Store event participation documents securely
    \item Ensure document availability without central server dependencies
    \item Create content-addressable references that prevent document tampering
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration Layer}
The integration layer connects the ElizaEdu system with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Existing ERP systems for attendance updates
    \item User interface applications (web portal and mobile app)
    \item Notification systems for status updates
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Workflow}
The ElizaEdu workflow consists of four main stages:

\subsubsection{Document Submission and Validation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Student submits event participation proof via web portal or mobile app
    \item RequestBot validates document format, extracts metadata, and checks for basic integrity
    \item Valid documents are stored on IPFS, and their content hash is recorded on Ethereum
    \item RequestBot generates a verification package with extracted metadata and document hash
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Class Teacher Verification}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item VerifyBot notifies class teacher of new verification request
    \item AI pre-screens document and provides validation confidence score
    \item Class teacher reviews verification package and approves/rejects
    \item Approval is cryptographically signed and recorded on blockchain
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{HoD Approval}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ApproveBot forwards teacher-approved requests to HoD
    \item HoD reviews verification package and teacher's approval
    \item HoD decision is cryptographically signed and recorded on blockchain
    \item Final approval status is updated in the system
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{ERP Integration and Notification}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ERPBot retrieves approved leave requests from blockchain
    \item Attendance records are automatically updated in the ERP system
    \item Students and teachers receive notifications of approval status
    \item Verification records are accessible through a transparent dashboard
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Smart Contract Design}
The Ethereum smart contracts in ElizaEdu implement the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DocumentRegistry}: Records document hashes, metadata, and verification status
    \item \textbf{ApprovalWorkflow}: Manages the approval process with role-based permissions
    \item \textbf{AttendanceUpdater}: Interfaces with ERP systems to update attendance records
    \item \textbf{AccessControl}: Manages user roles and permissions within the system
\end{itemize}

The smart contracts utilize Ethereum's native capabilities for cryptographic signatures and timestamp verification to ensure the integrity of the approval process.

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{ElizaOS Agent Implementation}
The ElizaOS agents were implemented using the ElizaOS framework, which provides a platform for creating autonomous AI agents that can communicate and collaborate. Each agent was designed with specific capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RequestBot}: Implemented using document analysis models (BERT-based) trained on a dataset of valid event certificates and participation proofs. It uses computer vision techniques for document structure analysis and NLP for content extraction.
    
    \item \textbf{VerifyBot}: Utilizes a confidence scoring mechanism that combines document features, institutional rules, and historical verification patterns to assist teachers in the approval process.
    
    \item \textbf{ApproveBot}: Implements policy-based verification to ensure compliance with institutional rules regarding leave eligibility, documentation requirements, and approval workflows.
    
    \item \textbf{ERPBot}: Uses secure API integrations with the ERP system to update attendance records based on blockchain-verified approvals.
\end{itemize}

The agent communication protocol was designed to ensure secure and reliable message passing between agents, with all communications logged for audit purposes.

\subsection{Ethereum Smart Contract Implementation}
The Ethereum smart contracts were developed using Solidity and deployed on a private Ethereum network for testing, with plans to migrate to Polygon for production to minimize transaction costs. Key implementation aspects include:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Solidity, caption=Document Registry Smart Contract (Simplified)]
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DocumentRegistry {
    struct Document {
        bytes32 contentHash;
        address submitter;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes metadata;
        bool teacherApproved;
        bool hodApproved;
        address teacherApprover;
        address hodApprover;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Document) public documents;
    
    event DocumentSubmitted(bytes32 indexed docId, address indexed submitter);
    event DocumentApproved(bytes32 indexed docId, address indexed approver, string role);
    
    function submitDocument(bytes32 docId, bytes32 contentHash, bytes calldata metadata) external {
        documents[docId] = Document({
            contentHash: contentHash,
            submitter: msg.sender,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            metadata: metadata,
            teacherApproved: false,
            hodApproved: false,
            teacherApprover: address(0),
            hodApprover: address(0)
        });
        
        emit DocumentSubmitted(docId, msg.sender);
    }
    
    function approveAsTeacher(bytes32 docId) external onlyTeacher {
        documents[docId].teacherApproved = true;
        documents[docId].teacherApprover = msg.sender;
        
        emit DocumentApproved(docId, msg.sender, "teacher");
    }
    
    function approveAsHod(bytes32 docId) external onlyHod {
        require(documents[docId].teacherApproved, "Teacher approval required first");
        
        documents[docId].hodApproved = true;
        documents[docId].hodApprover = msg.sender;
        
        emit DocumentApproved(docId, msg.sender, "hod");
    }
    
    // Role modifiers and other functions omitted for brevity
}
\end{lstlisting}

The smart contracts implement access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions, with role verification for teachers and HoDs.

\subsection{IPFS Integration}
The IPFS integration was implemented using the IPFS HTTP client library, with the following key features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Document encryption before storage to ensure privacy
    \item Content addressing for tamper-proof document referencing
    \item Pinning service integration to ensure document availability
\end{itemize}

The IPFS content identifiers (CIDs) are stored on the Ethereum blockchain as part of the document verification record, creating a secure link between the blockchain record and the stored document.

\subsection{User Interface}
The ElizaEdu user interface was developed as both a web application and a mobile app to provide flexibility in access:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web Portal}: Developed using React.js with Web3.js for blockchain integration
